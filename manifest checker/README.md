compare_path.py - Script to check if contents of a donor drive match their provided metadata spreadsheet. Will return flags if files in the metadata are not found on the drive, and if files are found on disk that are not present in the metadata. Requires fileList.txt manifest in same directory as script (see template in this repo).  Also verifies that filename prefixes match the prefix of their parent directory, and returns an error when they don't. Creates 3 reports (missing_files_report.csv, unexpected_files_report.csv, wrong_location_report.csv) in directory where script is executed.
