    "This notebook will help you create basic reports, securely copy files, and create BagIt-compliant packages complete with custom tags and profiles. It will also remove hidden macOS system files before hashing. It has been tested with a 64 bit Anaconda environment (featuring Jupyter Notebook) in Windows, but should work in macOS and system Python with minor adjustments. It requires BagIt python (https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagit-python) and Grabbags (https://github.com/amiaopensource/grabbags). Credit for metadata report and robocopy cells to staff at American Folklife Center!\n",

Be patient - for a large number of files, this may take several hours. When this step is complete, a .csv containing the report will be saved at ```home\\downloads\\fileinfo.csv```. If you are working with multiple drives, repeat this process for each but rename ```fileinfo.csv``` in Windows Explorer to avoid overwriting it."
